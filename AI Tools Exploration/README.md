##  AI Course Summary Video (Created with AI Tool)

**Tool Used:** [InVideo](https://invideo.io)  
**Final Output:** `AI_Course_Video.mp4`  
**Duration:** ~2.29 minutes  
**Voiceover:** Professional Male Voiceover (AI-generated)

###  How I Created It:

1. **Scriptwriting:**  
   I wrote a personalized script summarizing our full AI course — covering both theoretical topics like search algorithms, reasoning, NLP, and robotics, and practical lab work including Minimax, Alpha-Beta, and game implementations.

2. **Using InVideo:**  
   I used the **AI Text-to-Video** tool in InVideo to generate a professional video with automated visuals and voiceover narration.

3. **Visual Enhancements:**  
   I added visuals for:
   - Search trees (BFS, DFS, IDS, A*)
   - Games (Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Connect Four)
   - Graphs (Precision, Recall)
   - NLP workflows
   - Real-world robotics examples

4. **Export:**  
   The video was finalized and exported as `AI_Course_Video.mp4`.

##  AI Course Presentation (Created with AI Tool)

**Tool Used:** [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app)  
**Final Output:** `AI_Course_Presentation.pptx`  
**Slide Count:** 10 slides

###  How I Created It:

1. **Content Planning:**  
   I organized the presentation into 10 key slides covering:
   - Theory: Agents, search, CSP, logic, probabilistic reasoning, NLP, robotics  
   - Lab tasks: Minimax, Alpha-Beta, game implementation

2. **Using Gamma AI:**  
   I used **Gamma’s AI slide generator** to create layouts based on my content prompt.

3. **Customization:**  
   I enhanced the slides with:
   - Icons and charts
   - AI-related illustrations
   - Clean and dark-themed layouts

4. **Export:**  
   I exported the slides as `AI_Course_Presentation.pptx`.
