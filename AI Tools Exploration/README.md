##  AI Course Summary Video (Created with AI Tool)

**Tool Used:** [InVideo](https://invideo.io)  
**Final Output:** `AI Video.mp4`  
**Duration:** ~1.20 minutes  
**Voiceover:** Professional Female Voiceover (AI-generated)

###  How I Created It:

1. 📝 Scriptwriting:
I prepared a custom-written script that summarizes the entire AI course — highlighting key theoretical concepts such as search strategies, reasoning, natural language processing (NLP), and robotics, along with hands-on lab tasks like Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, and AI-based game development.

2. 🎬 Using InVideo:
I utilized InVideo's AI-powered Text-to-Video tool to create a polished and engaging video, complete with automated visuals and voiceover narration for a professional presentation.

3. **Visual Enhancements:**  
   I added visuals for:
   - Search trees (BFS, DFS, IDS, A*)
   - Games (Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Connect Four)
   - Graphs (Precision, Recall)
   - NLP workflows
   - Real-world robotics examples

4. **Export:**  
   The video was finalized and exported as `AI Video.mp4`.

##  AI Course Presentation (Created with AI Tool)

**Tool Used:** [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app)  
**Final Output:** `AI_Course_Presentation.pptx`  
**Slide Count:** 10 slides

###  How I Created It:

1. 🗂️ Content Planning:
I structured the presentation into 10 focused slides, covering:

Theoretical Topics 
– including agents, search strategies, constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), logical reasoning, probabilistic inference, natural language processing (NLP), and robotics

Lab Activities 
– such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and AI-based game implementations

2. **Using Gamma AI:**  
   I used **Gamma’s AI slide generator** to create layouts based on my content prompt.

3. **Customization:**  
   I enhanced the slides with:
   - Icons and charts
   - AI-related illustrations
   - Clean and dark-themed layouts

4. **Export:**  
   I exported the slides as `AI_Course_Presentation.pptx`.
