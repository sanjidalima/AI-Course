AI Course Summary – README

Purpose of the Course

This course offered a strong foundation in both the theory and practical application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on problem-solving with algorithms implemented in C++ and Python.


What I Learned

Theoretical Topics:


 - Introduction to AI and its applications
 - Types of AI: Narrow, General, Super
 - Intelligent Agents: Simple Reflex, Model-Based, Goal-Based, Utility-Based
 - Search Strategies:
 
    Uninformed Search:
     - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
     - Depth-First Search (DFS)
     - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
     - Bidirectional Search
     - Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
    
    Informed Search:
     - Heuristic Search
     - Best-First Search
     - AO* Algorithm
     - Beam Search

- Game Playing in AI:
    Minimax Algorithm
    Alpha-Beta Pruning

- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), Graph Coloring
- Consistency in CSP: Local, Path, k-, Global
- Branch and Bound Algorithm
- Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
- Uncertainty, Probability, Bayesian Inference
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Robotics and Machine Perception
 
         



Lab Tasks & Implemented Algorithms

All algorithms were implemented and tested using C++ or Python in lab sessions:


| Chapter| Algorithms Implemented     | 
| :-------- | :------- | 
| `3` | `BFS, DFS, IDS, DLS, Bidirectional Search` |
| `4` | `Heuristic, Best-First, AO*` | 
| `5` | `Beam Search` |
| `6` | `Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning` | 

Game Projects:

 - Tic Tac Toe AI using Minimax
 - Zoombie_escape
 - Chess AI (simplified version)

Real-world Simulations:

- Decision-making agents
- State-space problem solvers
