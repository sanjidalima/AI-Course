AI Games Collection – Challenge the Machine!
Welcome to AI Games, a collection of classic strategy games powered by intelligent decision-making algorithms. Whether you're trying to beat an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe bot, checkmating a smart Chess engine, or connecting four before a cunning AI opponent — this is your playground to test your wits against artificial intelligence.

What's Inside?
Each game is a complete implementation featuring:

Clean, modular Python source code
Built-in or GUI-based gameplay
AI logic using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and smart heuristics
Instructions, dependencies, and gameplay screenshots
Games Included
Game	Mode	AI Algorithm Used	Interface
🔲 Tic Tac Toe	You vs AI	Minimax (Unbeatable AI)	Tkinter GUI
♟️ Chess	You vs AI	Minimax + Alpha-Beta	Pygame GUI
🔴 Zhombie_Escaped	You vs Huristic 
How to Run
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Some games require additional libraries (see below)
Install Required Libraries
pip install pygame python-chess



Tic Tac Toe requires only built-in tkinter and math
Connect Four is fully terminal-based and needs no extra libraries

Each game folder contains an images/ folder with gameplay screenshots to give a quick preview.

Algorithms Behind the Scenes
Minimax – Recursive strategy used in two-player games to minimize opponent's best outcome

Alpha-Beta Pruning – Smart optimization to skip unnecessary branches in Minimax

Board Evaluation – Heuristic scoring of game states (especially in Chess and Connect Four)

Why This Project?
This collection showcases how AI can make optimal decisions even in simple games. It’s an educational and fun journey through classic AI search strategies.

Perfect for:
Beginners learning game AI
