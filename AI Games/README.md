## 📦 What's Inside?

Each game is a complete implementation featuring:

- ✅ Clean, modular Python source code  
- ✅ Built-in or GUI-based gameplay  
- ✅ AI logic using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and pattern-based prediction  
- ✅ Instructions, dependencies, and gameplay screenshots

## 🧩 Games Included

| Game             | Mode        | AI Algorithm Used              | Interface      |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| 🔲 Tic Tac Toe   | You vs AI   | Minimax (Unbeatable)           | Tkinter GUI    |
| ♟️ Chess         | You vs AI   | Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning   | Pygame GUI     |
| 🧟 Zombie Escape | You vs AI   | Pattern-Based Movement AI      | Pygame GUI     |

## ▶️ How to Run

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Some games require additional libraries

### 📦 Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pygame python-chess
```

✅ **Tic Tac Toe** only uses `tkinter` and `math` (built-in)  
✅ **Zombie Escape** and **Chess** require `pygame`
