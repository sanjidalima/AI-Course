 Depth-First Search (DFS)
‚úÖ How the Algorithm Works
Depth-First Search (DFS) explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.

Steps:
Start from the root node.

Mark it as visited and print it.

Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors.

Backtrack when no unvisited neighbors remain.

üß† Applications
Detecting cycles in graphs

Connected component detection

Topological sorting

Solving puzzles (e.g., mazes, Sudoku)

Pathfinding algorithms (as a base)

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity:
O(V¬≤) (because of the adjacency matrix)

Space Complexity:
O(V) for the visited array and recursive call stack
