 🔍 Algorithm Implementation

Welcome to the Algorithm Implementation section of the AI Course!

In this directory, you'll find C++ implementations of both classical and advanced search algorithms commonly used in Artificial Intelligence. Each algorithm is well-documented and includes a dedicated README file that outlines its working principle, practical applications, and computational complexity.

 ⚙️ How to Use

Each algorithm in this directory includes:

- 📄 A C++ implementation file (`.cpp`)
- 📝 A detailed README (`_README.md`) containing:
  - 🔍 Overview of the algorithm
  - 🧩 Step-by-step logic explanation
  - ⏱️ Time and space complexity analysis
  - 🧪 Example input and output
  - 🖼️ Visual illustrations (if available)

 ▶️ Running an Algorithm:
1. Open the corresponding `.cpp` file in your preferred C++ IDE or text editor.
2. Compile and run using your system’s C++ compiler instructions.
